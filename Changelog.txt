----------------------------
revision 1.5
date: 2004/10/09 00:24:18;  author: root;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -3
check for presence in the voicemail group instead of subscribed
----------------------------
revision 1.4
date: 2004/10/09 00:18:27;  author: root;  state: Exp;  lines: +22 -16
fixed a few things:  if in single-addr notify mode, dynamic generation of
new and old msg count is supported
in --all mode, the domain is no longer read from the grp table.  this
was messing up searching the asterisk vm spool
----------------------------
revision 1.3
date: 2004/10/08 23:54:49;  author: root;  state: Exp;  lines: +127 -61
added --all feature, which required a bit of cleanup in the code.
this feature will check every subscribed mailbox (using the ser grp table)
and send a notify that reflects current voicemail status
----------------------------
revision 1.2
date: 2004/10/08 22:31:52;  author: root;  state: Exp;  lines: +9 -9
call system w/an array, not a string -- much safer and more reliable
